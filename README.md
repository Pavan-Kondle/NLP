# Multi-Model Approach for Disease Detection Using Text Analysis

## 1. What is the research about?

- **Core Focus**: Applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** on pharmaceutical reviews to detect early signs of diseases caused by medications.  
- **Healthcare Relevance**: Improves **personalized treatment recommendations** and preventive healthcare.  
- **Sentiment & Context Analysis**: Classifies reviews into **positive, negative, neutral** while considering context and nuances.  
- **Integration of Knowledge**: Incorporates external medical knowledge (side effects, drug interactions, conditions) to improve accuracy.  
- **Deployment Goal**: User-friendly system for **healthcare professionals and patients**, providing insights, visualizations, and alerts for early disease identification.

## 2. Research Problem and Solution

### Problem
- Pharmaceutical reviews contain **technical jargon, subjective opinions, and nuanced sentiment**, making automated analysis difficult.  
- Existing sentiment analysis in healthcare struggles with **low accuracy, poor contextual awareness, and lack of medical knowledge integration**.  

### Solution
- **Sentiment Analysis Models**: Classify drug reviews (positive/negative/neutral).  
- **Disease Detection Models**: Deep learning (CNN, RNN, BiLSTM) to detect patterns between drugs, symptoms, and conditions.  
- **Feature Engineering & Embeddings**: Use n-grams, TF-IDF, and embeddings to capture semantic meaning.  
- **Medical Knowledge Integration**: Add data on side effects, drug interactions, and known conditions.  
- **Trust & Credibility Modeling**: Filter unreliable reviews by weighting reviewer reliability and consistency.  
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Preprocessing â†’ feature extraction â†’ model training â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment.
